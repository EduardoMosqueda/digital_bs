WP all import
Woocommerce

In october 2021 Venezuela had a law that made mandatory to display prices in 2 ways due to a change in the currency expresions.

As I had to display 2 different prices AT THE SAME TIME but no different currencies, I made this function that calculates the new price and added to a custom field. 
After that I just displayed the in every product with a woocommerce's hook
